## ‚ö° How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Simarpreet2743/OlaRideInsights.git
   cd OlaRideInsights
   ```

2. **Open your SQL environment**
   (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any SQL client like pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench).

3. **Create the database & table**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ola_rides_db;
   \c ola_rides_db;
   \i create_table.sql
   ```

4. **Import the dataset**
   Make sure the file path of `bookings.csv` is correct.

   COPY bookings(date, time, booking_id, booking_status, customer_id, vehicle_type, pickup_location, drop_location, v_tat, c_tat, canceled_rides_by_customer, canceled_rides_by_driver, incomplete_rides, incomplete_rides_reason, booking_value, payment_method, ride_distance, driver_ratings, customer_rating, vehicle_images)
   FROM 'D:/bookings.csv'
   WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', NULL 'null');
   ```

5. **Run all views**

   ```sql
   \i views.sql
   ```
